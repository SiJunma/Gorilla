            |  Like all other industries, law firms have also had to transition to the digital realm for advertising, marketing, lead generation and other business needs in the wake of the pandemic. After all, online marketing is the only reprieve from the cut-throat competition in the industry. <br>
            |  Chief among digital marketing strategies is inbound marketing, a reliable way to attract new clients to your firm.<br>
            |  The social distancing protocols, combined with the remote work model, have compelled people to spend more time online, and your business must follow them to their favorite social media and other online channels to vie for their attention and interest. <br>
            |  This is where inbound marketing shines; it not only gets them to take notice of your offers but also follow your calls to action. It’s an effective way to get your leads and prospects to sign up, get in touch or download your guides, making it an excellent strategy for law firms. <br>
            |  In simple terms, inbound marketing helps grow your brand using a combination of techniques and approaches to increase your law firm’s visibility online. And the reason why inbound marketing is so effective is that it emphasizes attracting leads instead of overwhelming potential customers with advertisements. <br>
            |  Let’s take a look at how your law firm can use inbound marketing.

          h5 Inbound Marketing – A Quick Primer

          p 
            |  As stated earlier, inbound marketing gives customers the liberty to come to you. To do this, you have to attract, engage, and meet their expectations.<br>
            |  The inbound marketing process begins by attracting customers. In the first phase, brand your services to be as unique as possible, using your experience, expertise, and niche as differentiators. This should get your intended audience to sit up and take notice.<br>
            |  Next, you make sure that your leads are educated, delighted, informed, and catered to with the help of attorney intake software. At this stage, provide them with an enticing offer to compel them to give you their email address and other contact info. Finally, build a database of your prospect’s contact information.<br>
            |  Once you are in touch with them using their information, it’s time to close the deal. Convert them into paying customers and give them stellar services as promised earlier. Let them know what sets your law firm apart from others.<br>
            |  And finally, never let them go. Once a customer, always a customer. Delight and engage them even after they’ve worked with you to ensure that the next time they need an attorney (and most of them will), they come running back to you instead of looking at your competitors.

          h5 Start A Blog

          img(src="img/blog-article__img2.jpg", alt=" ").article-img
          p 
            |  If you want to establish yourself as an authority on a subject matter, starting a blog is the best way to do that. That’s because it can empower your customers to find answers to the common queries or concerns they may have about different legal situations.<br>
            |  Writing a blog on subjects that the customers are searching for online gives you the chance to show your expertise in the industry. A blog can also direct relevant traffic onto your website and guide your clients on the next step they need to take to seek legal guidance.<br>
            |  When you are starting a blog, it is essential to cover two different types of topics. You can create posts about the industry trends, news, and updates that apply to a particular time, or you can choose to write on topics that remain relevant for several years. However, writing a blog post on its own is not enough. Instead, you must ensure that the content integrates relevant keywords or key phrases that the audience is searching for. Adding relevant keywords invites traffic to your content. You can find the right keywords for your blog by conducting keyword research.<br>
            |  Your blog post should also be attractive to the reader. Therefore, it is vital to write in clear, simple language that any individual can easily understand. To do this, write short and precise paragraphs, which are broken down using visuals. Additionally, using high-quality images on your website urges visitors to stay on your page longer.
